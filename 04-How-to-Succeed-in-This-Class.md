# How to Succeed in this Class (and in life)

If you wish to succeed in this class (and achieve a good grade), please do the following:

* Do all of the course activities listed on the [course website](https://crwr1200.netlify.com/category/activities/) and do them with enthusiasm. Do one activity each week for nine weeks.
* Do all of the [[readings|07-Resource.md]].
* Contribute consistently to your repository.
* Take the initiative to plan and develop your composition. This
  course is (very likely) more fluid and organic than you are used
  to. Your ability to manage your time, commitment, and energy is
  crucial.
* Donâ€™t look for the right answer to a question or challenge. Instead,
  find the answer that is meaningful to you.
* Ask for help if you need it. Open an issue if you need help (use the `Issues` tab).
* Commit to your composition in a substantial way. Good projects take
  time. Rushed projects are obviously rushed.

Finally, please be attentive to the [KPU policies](https://www.kpu.ca/policies on academic honesty and plagiarism.
